About the Project

Story Stellar is an interactive website created by Team Stellar Stories for the NASA Space Apps Challenge. Our project takes users on a fascinating journey through the life cycle of starsâ€”from their birth in nebulae to their transformation into red giants, white dwarfs, supernovae, black holes, and ultimately, stardust. The project highlights both the scientific journey of stellar evolution and the philosophical message of unity that connects humanity with the stars.

Why We Built This

We chose this project because stars are not just distant lights in the sky, but powerful engines that shape the universe and our existence. By explaining their journey in a simple, interactive way, we aim to inspire curiosity, creativity, and an appreciation of our cosmic connection.
